46,54,"Ozone was consistently associated with admissions for asthma and respiratory disease-with little evidence of a threshold. In two-pollutant models, the ozone effect was relatively unaffected by the control for high levels of other pollutants. Particulate pollution (measured by nephelometry) was associated positively with admissions for respiratory disease and admissions for asthma in summer, whereas a negative association was observed for cardiovascular admissions.

In a multi-pollutant model, O(3) was significantly associated with increased admissions for asthma. The younger age group (0-14 years) tended to have a higher RR for each 10 microg/m(3) increase in pollutants than those aged 15-65 years.

The relative risk (RR) of asthma visits for a 25 micrograms/m3 increase of current day concentrations of black smoke was 1.082 (95% CI 1.011 to 1.157). The mean current and previous three day levels of black smoke led to a stronger association (RR = 1.114 (95% CI 1.010 to 1.160).

56,64,Both ozone and primary pollutants from traffic sources were associated with emergency department visits for asthma or wheeze; evidence for independent effects of ozone and primary pollutants from traffic sources were observed in multipollutant models.
